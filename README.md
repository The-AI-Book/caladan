# Caladan

Caladan is a Python library designed to provide a set of tools for the Colombian Air Force in order to obfuscate and compress their images for both satellite and aerial data. This library is comprised of three different modules, each designed to tackle a specific problem.

The first module is designed to provide a means of obfuscating information contained within the images. This is done by creating false raster information that will mislead an attacker who has managed to gain access to the geographical information system where the images are stored.

The second module is designed to provide a means of quickly and easily previewing images within the SIG application. This is done by compressing the image by up to 90% while still maintaining the quality and pixel size.

The third module is designed to provide a means of compressing images by up to 90%. This is done by reducing the size of the image while still maintaining the quality and pixel size.

## Usage
